This data set consists of binary comparison patterns that were generated using a record linkage
of German cancer data.

The data set is hosted by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html)
named as
[Record Linkage Comparison Patterns Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Record+Linkage+Comparison+Patterns)

From the UCI data set description:

The records represent individual data including first and family name, sex, date of birth and postal code, which were
collected through iterative insertions in the course of several years. The comparison patterns in this data set are
based on a sample of 100,000 records dating from 2005 to 2008. Data pairs were classified as 'match' or 'non-match'
during an extensive manual review where several documentarists were involved. The resulting classification formed
the basis for assessing the quality of the registry's own record linkage procedure.
